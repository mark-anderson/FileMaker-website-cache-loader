FileMaker-website-cache-loader
==============================

FileMaker solution that visits each page in a specified xml sitemap for the purpose of loading that page into the web servers cache.

There are other ways of accomplishing this (curl-loader, wget, etc.) but the goal is for a single lightweight FileMaker solution that could run on an older machine, priming the caches of multiple sites on multiple servers with more granular control.
